# Rules for the $500 Cash Giveaway

---

### **Please ensure you read all the rules before entering.**

**All comments will be held for review for the first 48 hours of the contest**

---

#### **How to Participate:**

## Step 1.

Subscribe to the channel. I will be doing at least 10 more giveaways this year (non-interview videos). Use the bell if you want to get notified.

## Step 2.

Throughout the video (from start to finish), 5 (FIVE) different secret words will appear on different parts of the screen for a brief moment at random times. To enter the contest, you must make a comment that begins with one of the secret words, followed by your thoughts on the video or any criticisms you have (do you agree?, disagree?, share your thoughts, etc.)

For example, if you find the secret phrase “PANDA57”, your contest entry comment will look like this:

_**@JaneDoe**_ says:

```
PANDA57
I disagree with you because x, y, and z
```

## Step 3.

A maximum of TEN different winners will be selected.
Two winners for EACH of the 5 secret words will be RANDOMLY selected (using Python, see link below), making a total of 10 winners at $50 each, for a total of $500. HOWEVER, a single person can win a maximum of two times ($100 winnings max per person).

## Step 4.

To have a chance of winning more than once, you’ll have to make more than one entry, which means you’ll have to use a different secret word for a total of up to a maximum of 5 possible entries. For example, if the secret words are `[PANDA-55, FOX, DOG, P-22, CYBER-1]`, viewer "Jimmy" might find two of the secret words and decide to make two separate contest entry comments:

_**@Jimmy**_ says:

```
FOX
I agree with you because a, b, and c.
```

_**@Jimmy**_ says:

```
P-22
However, I disagree with you because of d, e, and f as well!
```

**DO NOT make more than 5 entries.**

## Step 5.

If you want to make life easy for me, watch your notifications for a reply from me in case you win. If you do win, please put your Venmo ID or PayPal ID in your YouTube channel page. For example, either of the following:

```
Venmo ID: @JoshMadakor
PayPal ID: @JoshMadakor
```

## Step 6.

The contest will run for at least 48 hours. When time is up, all comments will be approved and made visible and a video recording running the python code will be taken as proof. I will then pay the winners

---

## **Important Notice 1**

If I notice someone trying to cheat in any way or obviously doing something not in the spirit of the contest (for example, posting something that's obviously dumb) and you happen to “win”, I reserve the right to not pay you and pick the next person on the list.

---

## **Important Notice 2**

If you win and don't respond to my comments after 48 hours, I will give the next person in line who found the same secret word as you your winnings.
