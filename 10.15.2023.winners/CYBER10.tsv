Bob	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BXiYJsPzyXkbe38IgYpMg	CYBER10 - I agree that the pillars are a very realistic way of rating yourself. Too many people focus on just one or two of them like education and forget that it can only get you so far. Also your editing  has gotten noticeably better I like it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PPsufbJHhU&lc=Ugw-dj5qp8XNJ3nlEON4AaABAg	Ugw-dj5qp8XNJ3nlEON4AaABAg	2023-10-12T20:21:25Z	7PPsufbJHhU

DELAYS MADE	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDwcQ-816G7ChuNuWmR6mA	"CYBER10  Thank you for giving out this blueprint. I've seen many comments online saying taking the Google Cyberseurity Course won't get you a job. Of course, it won't, but it gives you so much information that you can build on to launch. And I also truly believe it's the best one out there. I'm at the ""Tools of the trade"" section, which has introduced me to Linux and SQL. That is wild and exciting for me. üòÖ.  Thank you for all you do."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PPsufbJHhU&lc=UgzQ8_XTjUcMfTQBpPV4AaABAg	UgzQ8_XTjUcMfTQBpPV4AaABAg	2023-10-13T17:16:12Z	7PPsufbJHhU
