Aiman Azha	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUzjUXxYqjZw7clcJreDEog	CISO!  Im on the fence on whether i disagree or agree with you. But you have definitely given me a new perspective on certifications. I realized that theres more than just certifications that I need to focus on if i want to break in.

Adamu Idris	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYaH73X6BH5IPk3Jzj-ih6g	CISO It's crucial to remember that certifications by themselves do not imply knowledge or competence in the area of cybersecurity.

Joe Joe	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3CuRVRdWc_c29Ye4c7IIg	CISO I kind of disagree with the degree part not being needed if the other areas are strong certifications and experience. It‚Äôs a lot of interviews where I have been rejected due to no degree. But I guess it‚Äôs the market right now and schools like WGU have folks out here with a degree and certifications. Plus the hiring managers are asking for a degree or 10+ yrs of experience for entry level. I‚Äôm not sure anymore if my skills will ever be more important than a degree in this market right now.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=Ugy2XkFSL9RmKJiu8Q14AaABAg	Ugy2XkFSL9RmKJiu8Q14AaABAg	2023-07-03T15:22:25Z	LweW1RypjD4

As a person who is making a career change at 29 years old with marketing background i think i have to get those certificates no matter what. I just finished Google's Cybersecurity program and now preparing for Security + which feels very theoretical and easy after Google's program. After that i will be getting my hands on Technical Skills with Blue Team 1 and ofcourse your program!  After that i think i will be confident and capable enough to apply for the jobs for real.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgyaoJXhphZRrhCAS1V4AaABAg	UgyaoJXhphZRrhCAS1V4AaABAg	2023-07-03T18:06:44Z	LweW1RypjD4

Fuenini	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HnNMfAcBVCrky_Fr8Amsw	CISO I have a friend who do no even have any certificates nor prior experience and got the job right away when they asked her this one question. A question about how to test employees about cybersecurity knowledge and how to mitigate. She literally just said that she will send fake phising emails to test how vulnerable the company and got the job on the spot. As someone who Is still studying, I was flabbergasted when she told me what happened in the interview.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzVCcXM4wExRWpvOi54AaABAg	UgzVCcXM4wExRWpvOi54AaABAg	2023-07-04T16:17:35Z	LweW1RypjD4

Evan Redden	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQHNDJ5V6XES4g7fw-B7Fg	CISO  I looked through your Python script for selecting secret word comments to see how it worked, and I noticed that you made a function to delete old CSV files used for previous contests. Your program then creates a new CSV file to replace the old file and appends new data to that file.   However, this process could be simplified by opening the file (using Python's built-in open function) and overwriting it to turn it into a blank CSV. From there, your new data can be appended to the same file. That way you do not have to delete a file and then make a new one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=Ugz68kitA4AfjUTGl4R4AaABAg	Ugz68kitA4AfjUTGl4R4AaABAg	2023-07-03T15:02:33Z	LweW1RypjD4
Lenin Machado	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK3IEaGFmRdrR7sqDLq-AHA	CISO  I agree with your perspective in this video because, after conducting additional research and watching your videos, I am starting to realize that there isn't just one path to enter the field of tech and cybersecurity. There are numerous avenues to explore.

The discussion on the value of certifications, particularly CompTIA Security Plus, was enlightening. I appreciate how you emphasized the importance of considering certifications as just one aspect of a holistic set of skills and qualifications. The analogy of treating yourself as a character in an RPG game and acquiring different ""stats"" was a unique and effective way to convey the idea. Your breakdown of the various stats, such as consistency, communication, technical ability, and formal education, provided a clear framework for evaluating one's readiness for a career in cybersecurity. The comparison between Security Plus and Google's cyber security program was also intriguing, highlighting each option's strengths and considerations.

I have currently put a hold on stacking up the certs and focusing more on polishing my skills through platforms like hackthebox and tryhackme etc. However, since the platform is pretty broad and covers various aspects and topics, is it a good choice to stick with these platforms or should we be picking a skill (for example linux) and just focus on that for a few weeks before moving on to something else. I feel like there is SO MUCH to practice out there that it easily overwhelms a layman like myself and I feel like I am racing against time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzN-nsvf5aFfXU5UZZ4AaABAg	UgzN-nsvf5aFfXU5UZZ4AaABAg	2023-07-05T12:16:12Z	LweW1RypjD4

PJ DuHamel	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCixXKx8gq-imYjErY0Of3hw	CISO  I totally agree that Certs =/= Technical Ability. I have, and currently work with government contracts that require techs have Sec+, and half the people I've worked with cannot even competently troubleshoot basic end user problems. It's more of a contractual requirement for the employer, and a gatekeeper for resumes to get through HR.   I'm revisiting A+ due to WGU's coursework, and find that a lot of principles I've shared from A+ (most notably their troubleshooting methodology) was WAY more beneficial for techs, than the entire Sec+ certification. This opinion is of course focused around those help desk roles, but regardless...a certification is only a small  piece of the puzzle. And HOW you gained that cert is equally important. Memorizing answers =/= learning the content and applying it until you understand it.

FrodoBe_TBaggin	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRxVjbudNAMAyof0gJL9G8w	CISO:  I do agree with you. I personally think Sec+ is good baseline security cert. it is wildly overpriced but I think that‚Äôs because of the DoD IAT requirement. The thing is I have met too many ppl who have Sec+ and are clueless about basic security concepts. However, this is also the same with CISSP lol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzYnYiRxYQuTev0mVx4AaABAg	UgzYnYiRxYQuTev0mVx4AaABAg	2023-07-05T03:33:03Z	LweW1RypjD4

Abdul	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1fM91BK8Y4KJAmzON5elA	CISO  The decision between CompTIA Security+ and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate ultimately comes down to your professional objectives, the local employment market, and the particular technologies or platforms you want to work with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgyeGeJ4zSqF4jZdkil4AaABAg	UgyeGeJ4zSqF4jZdkil4AaABAg	2023-07-03T20:10:03Z	LweW1RypjD4

bagery	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoS6i0_VrVDHnJsHp6cctlQ	CISO  I'm struck by the hoops newbies are being told to jump throughout Information Technology. We were told for the last 10-15 years that the jobs were exploding here. As we make attempts to transition over, there's a gold standard guards want us to meet to be worthy of employment.   I'm learning web development too. These certificates and certifications seem to equal data structures and algorithms.  Thank-you for going back to $500 to give me a fair chance to snatch up both courses at once and add some marketable skills to my resume.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgyUkuh2U7uLo6DmzpJ4AaABAg	UgyUkuh2U7uLo6DmzpJ4AaABAg	2023-07-03T17:45:49Z	LweW1RypjD4

Palm_Tree_Nerd	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkH6Nx2XNGvedoAEwO8bC7g	CISO I'm hopefully (finally) getting my first role in IT after my 20 year military career and I 100% agree that it is in one way a gatekeeping function. One thing that the initial interviewer told me was that they chose to approach me because I have A+ and Sec+. I asked what might be covered in the technical interview (hopefully later this week) and she assured me that it was more of a personality interview than a technical one because those certs certainly got my foot in the door (not sure the truth of that, I'll let you know lol).  In any case, I agree, it's not a bad trade-off and I seem to have a knack for it.
