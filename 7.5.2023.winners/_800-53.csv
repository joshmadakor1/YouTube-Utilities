Paul Okeyo	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYGVQR-YZqs7dXQf_swavA	800-53 I agree with you because it is often required or preferred by employers when hiring for roles such as security analyst, security engineer, or security specialist.

Certifications are for both you and the employer. Its to help you get passed the firewall to get an interview and to give you the confidence you need to pass an interview. The feeling of completing something you worked very hard for is such an aawesome feeling…besides, when you are feeling down, you can refer to the certification as a reminder that you can do it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgyPVmwR1o2rS0QBavF4AaABAg	UgyPVmwR1o2rS0QBavF4AaABAg	2023-07-03T14:52:25Z	LweW1RypjD4

The analogy of treating yourself as a character in an RPG game and acquiring different ""stats"" was a unique and effective way to convey the idea. Your breakdown of the various stats, such as consistency, communication, technical ability, and formal education, provided a clear framework for evaluating one's readiness for a career in cybersecurity.

It shouldn't be something that is solely relied on to get through a job interview, or to work in the field.

Cameron Crowe	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSenT39v-ouMasc9fyaP-Xg	"800-53 I agree with the way you look at certifications. I know that most people like me who are switching careers into cybersecurity or IT in general, see what the employers post that they are looking for in someone and immediately feel like they need these certain certs to even qualify to apply. So a lot of people feel the need to get those certs, but I've seen people that have those certs that have had others picked over them, simply because those people were able to ""build up their armor"" so they are well rounded instead of just a bunch of certifications to throw on the resume. I've spoken to a guy that has a computer science degree but he confessed he didn't know much when it came to networking, Linux, etc, and that he spent a few years just doing the degree but nothing outside of that. And he found other people with no degree but knew all of those things he didn't actually learn in his classes. So just because you go and get a degree or a certification doesn't mean you'll have it in the bag and can call it a day lol.  By the way Josh, your content is great and helpful and you inspire so many people!"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=Ugzf0t80PRzU7I79n9Z4AaABAg	Ugzf0t80PRzU7I79n9Z4AaABAg	2023-07-03T16:27:03Z	LweW1RypjD4
Wei Huang	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrs7hwONqQ_L_9q3YdNlDWg	800-53 I think getting certs shows the employer you were willing to work for a new job.

CISO: Good salary but very stressful job. 800-53: It is good since it is continuously updated to other framework and compliance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgwC8kSR2k8eq6Vxezh4AaABAg	UgwC8kSR2k8eq6Vxezh4AaABAg	2023-07-05T03:00:39Z	LweW1RypjD4
Tribbles	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUPB6RKXTfEX8gim4iL56w	800-53 I agree certs aren’t everything , people will get a job without certs. However for someone like me that is trying to get an entry level job I’m not letting the HR team have any excuses to not hire me , I want a masters in cyber with cissp eventually plus all the other stats maxed 😂	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgwK1lryAW_G3-K3tgx4AaABAg	UgwK1lryAW_G3-K3tgx4AaABAg	2023-07-03T17:44:09Z	LweW1RypjD4

Please make more analogies like flipping off the interviewer haha.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgxMXpHpUrBY_JVV9AR4AaABAg	UgxMXpHpUrBY_JVV9AR4AaABAg	2023-07-03T17:44:00Z	LweW1RypjD4

Juan Ochoa	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzDPeyeXXZQ98ICt4HVo8Hw	800-53  I am trying to break into the field and I started with learning web development. That's when my wife told me about cybersecurity I took the google cert and finished which I think is a good start to go on to security + but I am not sure what the next step would be after I finish the cert. I really want this big career change and I am studying very hard. I am also taking a udemy class to get more hands on expraince with how to hack basic things	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgwXTA4_hSIA3GAdCtp4AaABAg	UgwXTA4_hSIA3GAdCtp4AaABAg	2023-07-03T15:36:26Z	LweW1RypjD4
