bell	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCELAY5TkosULFPLUO-jTWLQ	PCI I like this video and you made some great points, but I think you didn't mention how important formal education is. From my own experience, having a bachelors degree is the only way to get your foot in the door these days. It doesn't guarantee you a job, but is very hard to get a job in Cybersecurity or IT without having a bachelors degree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=Ugz_bR6HlqziSNOaL2h4AaABAg	Ugz_bR6HlqziSNOaL2h4AaABAg	2023-07-03T15:36:40Z	LweW1RypjD4

Kaleb	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaqyOWZ1vB-6utsmTUZJftA	PCI I agree with the overall message of the video, however I think that you may be overstating the value of the Google security cert a little too much. The description of the Google certification says that it helps you prepare for the CompTIA Security+ exam, so I think that while they are very similar, the CompTIA certs will always hold more value and is a better use of money. I guess it depends on the employer, too. I know some employers are specifically looking for Sec+ and may automatically reject the application if you don't have it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=Ugzy1TLSgARt2fKrEAB4AaABAg	Ugzy1TLSgARt2fKrEAB4AaABAg	2023-07-03T20:15:01Z	LweW1RypjD4

Paul Okeyo	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYGVQR-YZqs7dXQf_swavA	PCI I agree with you on the importance of certification in cybersecurity because some certifications provide a benchmark for your skills and capabilities at a particular point in your career. For example CISSP by ISC2 that requires a level of  experience before being undertaken.

StopTheCap	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT2OQmLwOJ1mnu8eTQQTVsw	PCI  Before I answer, I just wanted to say that If one is looking to pursue a cybersecurity role with the government, then yes, Sec+ is a prerequisite. For those looking to break into the field, I believe acquiring the certification might depend on one's financial position and to what extent they're willing to pay for a bundled product or just a voucher. Furthermore, I feel that on its own, the certification is worth it but would have more value if the individual can show they have knowledge applying the concepts that the certification tests on. Finally, if one were to follow your course, I've seen in another one of your videos continued learning recommendations, you did suggest the AZ-900, AZ-500 and if I'm not mistaken, the Sec+ as paths to pursue beyond the course.  As far as the video goes, I agree with the evaluations you make especially the importance of communication and resume quality as the goal isn't just to get past the resume scans, but to have human eyes want to interview you and then have the ability to communicate your skills and capabilities.  Edit...If I win, and if it's an option, rather than $500, I'd rather have the course and all the bells and whistles that go along with it, including the invaluable opportunity to contribute in the Discord community for having you as a reference and job experience!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzKtTXvvVfwlnOBPzd4AaABAg	UgzKtTXvvVfwlnOBPzd4AaABAg	2023-07-03T17:22:43Z	LweW1RypjD4

Dan Peoples	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ0ap0BiCbldHpAQ98VRL3A	"PCI   A few random takeaways that I would like to share @JoshMadakor are ‚Ä¶   1)	Relating an MMORPG reward system to think in terms of how to build out a ‚Äúbody of work‚Äù for one‚Äôs resume, is an excellent way to approach building or leveling up your game IRL.   2)	Maybe ChatGPT can be thought of as an ethical exploit for the MMO of RL üòâ   3)	I have found that Security+ is incredibly important to have (for better or worse) in the DoD space, companies use the headcount of Security+ employees to weigh/offset how certain aspects of the business are affected by external audits (hence the importance for the certification) Unfortunately people will skip important foundational knowledge in pursuit of just the one Security+ certification. The Google cybersecurity certification is far and away much better than Security+ for practical knowledge in my opinion (I‚Äôm only partially done as of this writing).  4)	Regarding the ‚Äústat‚Äù of technical ability (@10:51) I like to remember the inspiration of Arnold Schwarzenegger.    ‚ÄúImagine if your read for one hour a day, how much would you learn in 365 hours, in one year?‚Äù    And ‚Ä¶       ''You can't get around the hard work.

Aaron Vanhook	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoS4-4SEX7dhAJgV0SJ3Ubg	PCI People like Josh are unsung heroes. Literally, providing mentorship and guidance out of, what feels like charity, is invaluable. Again, thank you!  Having focused on these areas myself is essentially what landed me a Helpdesk role.   Although, I didn‚Äôt take his course, his free content supplemented my trajectory, and allowed me to hone in on the areas that really matter in the job search game.   I do agree that covering all of your bases to the best of your ability most certainly leaves an impression. IF you effectively used your time in developing these areas towards a tailored goal, then the only limit to you landing an interview is you‚Äôre own personal preferences. Just don‚Äôt underestimate the amount of time/focus it actually takes to make your weaknesses your strengths. Stay persistent!  Out of all the content irt IT ‚ÄúHireability‚Äù, I believe Josh‚Äôs content is King for those of us new to the game.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzzR4I8YFPc8R7nBzV4AaABAg	UgzzR4I8YFPc8R7nBzV4AaABAg	2023-07-05T02:30:01Z	LweW1RypjD4
The Baylis Code	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK8zdyevjTlRB6WQy2uzM_g	PCI  I usually suggest getting the Sec+ and combining it with a cloud cert and a tool cert (example: Google Cybersecurity, Sec+, CCSK, Azure Security Engineer, Burp Suite) and while you are going through the journey of getting them, post about it all over social media‚Ä¶doing this will put you on recruiters radars. When they search your name, the recruiter needs to get the understanding that you ARE a cyber security analyst‚Ä¶even if you have only been doing it for the past 3 to 6 months	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgyvCnt8xSlwLfiNAnJ4AaABAg	UgyvCnt8xSlwLfiNAnJ4AaABAg	2023-07-03T14:53:25Z	LweW1RypjD4

Dhruv Patel	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPn438QUYXM0vYfZsUl064Q	PCI:  It is good since it helps to  avoid fraudulent activity and mitigate data breaches by keeping the cardholder's sensitive financial information secure. CISO: Good salary but very stressful job. 800-53: It is good since it is continuously updated to other framework and compliance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgwC8kSR2k8eq6Vxezh4AaABAg	UgwC8kSR2k8eq6Vxezh4AaABAg	2023-07-05T03:00:39Z	LweW1RypjD4

Zaofactor	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IT57lZDTkUC3JbNGryzPw	PCI  I agree with your stance on comptia certs and their importance in getting a job.

Cyber Pro Austin	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2fut5tiCl3CIZR8NJdsY6w	PCI  I agree with you that Security+ isn't necessary, but I don't think it's all bad. I think the issue is, it isn't really a cybersecurity certification. To me, its more like ensuring that entry level IT professionals conduct themselves with security in mind.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgxDHwla4TJzdnOwleJ4AaABAg	UgxDHwla4TJzdnOwleJ4AaABAg	2023-07-03T14:36:53Z	LweW1RypjD4
