Fuenini	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HnNMfAcBVCrky_Fr8Amsw	RMF I also agree with creating your online profile with all your experience and achievements e.g LinkedIn. It feels more professional and will definitely increase your likelihood of getting the role. It's taking some time and I'm still working on mine but I'm sure this will only help me in the long run. I may have to change my resume without all the fancy graphics as you said to make sure   I don't get filtered in their system just because. Thank you for the advice.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzdspEr8Fs1uJmlXcB4AaABAg	UgzdspEr8Fs1uJmlXcB4AaABAg	2023-07-04T16:31:40Z	LweW1RypjD4

Basic_Beny	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvDAVDAtmGvaAwM5V2tOTDg	RMF; I agree with this sentiment.

Cameron Crowe	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSenT39v-ouMasc9fyaP-Xg	RMF  This was a great video. I have had trouble trying to figure out which courses to take to add to my knowledge and resume so I can stand out, since money is an issue it gets a little tricky as well. I'm on a journey to see how much I can learn using free access courses and hope when I get hired by a company, I can use their funding to pay for me to get the certifications I would like to eventually have. For now, it's down to learning the right things as well as being able to articulate myself and what I've learned/and learning still in an interview. The hardest thing for me is making myself more visible to companies through my resume and applications.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgxKuViai4c8zRetIv14AaABAg	UgxKuViai4c8zRetIv14AaABAg	2023-07-03T16:12:13Z	LweW1RypjD4

YeeInTheLab	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClxdV9fINMAuWF_Qb370yKg	RMF: Overall I mostly agree with the video because any certification will only help if you‚Äôre patient and actually learn and let all the information digest.

Guy Person III	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9ooX1KuhP5DKFsIC0EdzQ	RMF  I agree with your Sec+ take.  HR looks at it and assumes you have a good enough working knowledge for hiring.

Joe Joe	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3CuRVRdWc_c29Ye4c7IIg	RMF I agree with you on security+ being good based on what direction you‚Äôre going in cybersecurity or what company you‚Äôre working for. Some people will have to look at the job description of the jobs they want to do and base it off that. For a person like me who‚Äôs being tortured in GRC a CISSP is more important than a security+ certification. But a cloud engineer a security+ would be great for that position. But like you said it all depends on what company and job you‚Äôre going for.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgyhGQmq-NVXcj8iH_l4AaABAg	UgyhGQmq-NVXcj8iH_l4AaABAg	2023-07-03T14:57:08Z	LweW1RypjD4

I appreciate how you emphasized the importance of considering certifications as just one aspect of a holistic set of skills and qualifications. The analogy of treating yourself as a character in an RPG game and acquiring different ""stats"" was a unique and effective way to convey the idea. Your breakdown of the various stats, such as consistency, communication, technical ability, and formal education, provided a clear framework for evaluating one's readiness for a career in cybersecurity.

But for me, school has been great for me. It's given me a good foundation.  I started watching you in 2017 I believe, and got so happy you finally came out with your own class lol.. it's given me so much needed direction and guidance.  If someone can break into the cybersecurity field without any education and pure skill, hats off to you. But I was completely lost and almost hopeless that It would be able to happen for me.  I'm sorry if you ever get rude comments josh.. just know you are much appreciated.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgwVKHLyhRIh5WkUNSx4AaABAg	UgwVKHLyhRIh5WkUNSx4AaABAg	2023-07-03T15:18:30Z	LweW1RypjD4

I will definitely be making sure my resume + applications are perfect.  I do have a question about portfolios - I am a college student, and most of the programs or research I've done are very narrowly-focused and in general computer science, rather than cybersecurity. I feel that if I were to make a portfolio with class projects, they would be irrelevant to a cybersecurity position.

You still need to be good at what you do and be able to communicate that even without the certs.

But, I don't believe that happens often when you're stats are high unless you're new or in a highly competitive area like NY or Bay area. It happens :c, just gotta be at the right level for the area that you're in. If you really want secret clearance I'd say sure go for the security + or a CCNA. I think it might be a higher level clearance or just in more areas (don't quote me plz). TLDR: Sec+ is not necessary but, can help (plz learn it) Don't gotta to be the best.

Michael Wells	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LM6tec_2Hi9EI-f2yF2Lg	RMF I do agree that having a portfolio might be the best way to go. Every job wants to see that you have real world experience yet the only way you would probably get that before getting the job would be by doing it on your down time when you are not working, else you would already have the job. Plus that portfolio can constantly grow when you want to have a slight change of pace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgwMOm0dr-lPwtZRrAl4AaABAg	UgwMOm0dr-lPwtZRrAl4AaABAg	2023-07-03T17:58:04Z	LweW1RypjD4
Paul Okeyo	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYGVQR-YZqs7dXQf_swavA	RMF  I agree because Security+ certification is also a stepping stone for further professional growth. It can serve as a prerequisite for higher-level certifications such as CISSP, CEH, or CISM. These advanced certifications can unlock more senior-level roles and opportunities for career progression.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgzusiLB2k0yyFuVB7l4AaABAg	UgzusiLB2k0yyFuVB7l4AaABAg	2023-07-04T08:25:06Z	LweW1RypjD4
