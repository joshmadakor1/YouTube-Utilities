Faris	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYEM68jLnfE3DuzsPjGXf7Q	NIST I disagree to an extent on the basis of the stat system being the only system. What I mean to a degree is, one can max out what they can possibly but its still onthe whims of a recruiter or hiring manager or external circumstances. The stats are better probabilities of success but I think the guage is upper limit of 50 per cent and the other 50 per cent is on the whims of others. So in my mind, there is two systems or set of stats to be considered.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=Ugye_Rg0We8Icf9G9054AaABAg	Ugye_Rg0We8Icf9G9054AaABAg	2023-07-04T01:56:53Z	LweW1RypjD4

The analogy of treating yourself as a character in an RPG game and acquiring different ""stats"" was a unique and effective way to convey the idea. Your breakdown of the various stats, such as consistency, communication, technical ability, and formal education, provided a clear framework for evaluating one's readiness for a career in cybersecurity.

scorpionsoul10	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZfZsuJbDC32JewE1Zc2DdA	Secret Word: NIST  (comment #1) Hey Josh, Thank you for all the videos and content you share with us. I have recently embarked on transitioning into an IT career and while my experience is next to nothing, I do agree with the points you made. I was enrolled in a scholarship bootcamp where I completed my SANS sec401 certification. Prior to this, I was self studying for security+ exam. I realized that sans course was more hands on with various labs whereas security+ was entirely a MCQ style format. I was super confident upon completing my sec401 with Sans and proudly put it on my resume only to realize that it was not one of the certs that would make it through the 'gatekeepers'. I barely have secured any interview in the past 2 months and the ones I did, the recruiters were not too keen of the sec401 and most have not heard of it. I get it, not a lot of people actually opt for those certs because of the price point but, it is a bit frustrating at the same time when you can't make it past the gatekeepers and now have to go back to getting a cert that may not help me achieve a higher skill set but will most likely make it through the gatekeepers. I see that you make the same point about google's cybersecurity cert..this whole journey of breaking into IT can be a bit frustrating for those that are making transition into IT with no prior IT experience. >_<	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LweW1RypjD4&lc=UgywZ8YBW9c6Yodc5pR4AaABAg	UgywZ8YBW9c6Yodc5pR4AaABAg	2023-07-05T11:55:54Z	LweW1RypjD4

Evan Redden	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQHNDJ5V6XES4g7fw-B7Fg	NIST  I would definitely agree with your opinion on the Security+ and other IT certs not necessarily reflecting that you have the skills to do a certain job or task. I studied for the Security+ for about a month and passed this past February, but I wouldn't say I am capable of defending an enterprise network. However, the Security+ did give me better insight into the duties and responsibilities of cybersecurity workers, the threats they may deal with, and the tools used to protect systems and networks from those threats. It definitely looks great on a resume though, landing my first IT job with a company partially thanks to my CompTIA trifecta.

But I've also seen in government jobs it is absolutely a requirement.  I'm not sure, but the government jobs will offer to pay for you to get this certification only if you're already in a role.
