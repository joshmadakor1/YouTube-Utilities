First off, verifying social proof is important as it allows individuals to gauge the experiences of past students and their satisfaction with the course. This helps ensure that one is investing time and money in a reputable and effective learning opportunity. Moreover, clear curriculum ensures that the course covers the specific topics and skills one is interested in, aligning with their learning goals. Lastly, upfront pricing and a transparent refund policy are crucial factors to consider, as they provide financial security and confidence in one's investment, ensuring that one has a recourse if the course fails to meet one's expectations or circumstances change."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgyH5TRgid1rCxJm-5t4AaABAg	UgyH5TRgid1rCxJm-5t4AaABAg	2023-07-10T09:34:09Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

I don't fall for the too good to be true bit, but these guys made learning how to code seem like so much FUN!! Then things went to crap... lawyers got involved... bottom line is I do have an old school mentality about education. No Degree = 'not real education'. But I'm QUICKLY LEARNING that mentality is 100% trash!! I recently finished the GRC Master Class by DR. Gerald Auger, PhD. and landed my 1st interview like a week later for an IT Audit position!! I don't know if I got the job but that experience SPEAKS VOLUMES!!!  Not sure when I'll get to it, but I definitely want to take advantage of your course.
