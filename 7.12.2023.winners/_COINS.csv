Aiman Azha	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUzjUXxYqjZw7clcJreDEog	COINS!  I think it depends on the course. Some courses just have good marketing but the contents are super bad. To avoid this, I usually do my research on utube and reddit üòÇ  Speaking about researching on youtube, ive decided to skip security+ and enrolled in google‚Äôs course instead. Thanks to you josh!!

Ji Su Lee	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2UWNs5J0UC24YSB6o8TUA	"COINS  Hi Josh, I began my journey into cybersecurity no too long ago. I worked for an AI company and got a bit of second-hand exposure of cybersecurity. I thought that it was pretty cool and interesting so after a couple months, I took a leap of faith and began doing a bunch of research.  Mainly through your channel and many different channels, I had always had a bit of disbelief towards ""online courses"" as well, but after personally going through an online course, I was able to learn so much and also build the hands-on experience I really needed. I'm in WGU's Cybersecurity program and I always felt like while the material is great, it really lacks the hands-on experience. To cover this area, I registered for a separate onpine course and it's been great! I feel like they're a lot more helpful because you have to push yourself in order to participate and really force yourself to learn."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgxBszMrV2OrSaT4BxB4AaABAg	UgxBszMrV2OrSaT4BxB4AaABAg	2023-07-10T08:22:42Z	yVEjs_9CyU4
Jonathan Cruz	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrOCGYttdEoqux37JCcePdg	COINS I agree with you because the value of education is in its practical application and return on investment. Not all education has to come from traditional sources, as you have demonstrated through your personal experiences. The stigma around online courses from individuals or small businesses is often misguided. Like any education, value comes from the knowledge acquired and its application. Investing in ourselves is the best thing we can do, and we should be smart about it.

Zeze	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktCKzmUHOTXiVLDEdnKUCA	COINS  I wholeheartedly agree with the college not being everyones choice opinion and for personal reasons as well.    I decided to sign up for community college straight out of highschool. However, I dropped out multiple times of about 3-4 semesters of trying. I was not mentally and emotionally healthy enough to tackle college.  I decided to stop college because I needed money and I was spending too much on school for practically nothing since I wasn‚Äôt passing classes.  I already had an interest in computers and luckily I was hired on as an IT technician for a local library. From there I got the comptia A+ certificate and have been hired on from multiple companies including Dell.   6 years later and I am still working in IT. However, thanks to Josh, I decided to go back to school and will be taking WGU‚Äôs Software Engineering course because of the past years I really grew a liking to programming.  I think the difference about me going back to school is because it‚Äôs on MY terms and it‚Äôs something that I want rather than someone‚Äôs wants ex: parents and society. As well as I am now mentally and emotionally stable to take on college responsibilities and actually looking forward to it.   I will also be taking Josh‚Äôs course because I really like how he is actively engaged about it on his YouTube channel and interviewing people that took it. I think his course will help me get a step further away from general IT, which I‚Äôve been in for quite sometime now and am looking to learn a new skill set :). That‚Äôs where I think courses beat college, a relatively quick way to gather skills without having to use a lot of your valuable time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgyqNiUf7WIFhH1Qk154AaABAg	UgyqNiUf7WIFhH1Qk154AaABAg	2023-07-10T18:40:18Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

Not only would Mr. Madakor's program address that, but we will actually and practically learn how to do something in accordance with the job we are chasing after.
