Frank Noneofya	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkUTFrBUcT0PIBbkrl2FNsw	I'm one of the stingiest people in this world when it comes to buying knowledge. Mostly because I have taken sources where I don't value or might already know what has been taught. Happened with the first course at college into Cybersecurity. That cost me 1200 and then just dropped out of the course because it was useless. I brought your course because it was something that I would learn and I knew who would be teaching it, since I was already investing content you share for free and determined that it was well worth spending the money on someone who's already given me so much knowledge for free. That's my 2 cents...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgwAibYAr5H4ziSx_YR4AaABAg	UgwAibYAr5H4ziSx_YR4AaABAg	2023-07-10T11:24:32Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

I worked for an AI company and got a bit of second-hand exposure of cybersecurity. I thought that it was pretty cool and interesting so after a couple months, I took a leap of faith and began doing a bunch of research.  Mainly through your channel and many different channels, I had always had a bit of disbelief towards ""online courses"" as well, but after personally going through an online course, I was able to learn so much and also build the hands-on experience I really needed. I'm in WGU's Cybersecurity program and I always felt like while the material is great, it really lacks the hands-on experience. To cover this area, I registered for a separate onpine course and it's been great! I feel like they're a lot more helpful because you have to push yourself in order to participate and really force yourself to learn."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgxBszMrV2OrSaT4BxB4AaABAg	UgxBszMrV2OrSaT4BxB4AaABAg	2023-07-10T08:22:42Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

Ashley Drakes	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qOuyHIoHOYQs09mqRvnGg	"YOUR Hi Josh! l agree that all courses are not a scam. People should do their due diligence with what they are going to gain from the course, what projects they will do, how long will it takes, and maybe most importantly who is teaching the course. I've seen people who aren't even in cyber selling courses of how to break in. I've also seen people who are in cyber, but do not know how to put cohesive courses together for people to follow along to.   I think when you're buying from a smaller creator like yourself, it is more important about the projects and how to put your resume together in order to get hired. Of course, you have a youtube channel with other walkthroughs and are reputable. I wouldn't expect anyone to put ""Josh's Cyber Course"" on a resume haha"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgyJjY1zhqQXsTxb5F14AaABAg	UgyJjY1zhqQXsTxb5F14AaABAg	2023-07-10T14:16:26Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

I’m a full time IT engineer and trying to find balance with work and life. If you tell me that there’s an opportunity for me to get some real cybersecurity experience and it’s affordable, sign me up. ————————— YOUR I’ve spent a lot of time researching cybersecurity certification and reputable training vendors and often times I hate the fact that often times I just end up selling my information to get the info on tuition and course outlines just to find out that it’s way too expensive. Glad to know I’m not the only one who feels that way. ————————— COINS I’ve also bought Mosh’s coding courses as well, he has a great content  and training delivery that doesn’t feel dry and rehearsed. I enjoyed the .NET series and his course gave me a head start on a few of my coding projects in my previous role.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=Ugwh57L5dGdNJCAm4DJ4AaABAg	Ugwh57L5dGdNJCAm4DJ4AaABAg	2023-07-10T23:20:31Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

KanKen	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiAli_jr1-F63ey3K7zNvzA	"With    Your opinion being added, I think what you obtain from courses compared to the price point is extremely important. I've rarely used courses due to the fact that there's a lot of information for free, so I've always been skeptical. Whilst time is important to save, there are still a lot of good free compact courses to choose from. But if the price of the course is cheaper in comparison of under triple digits, I'm much more inclined to give it a try. I think in this current economy, taking the risk for a 500$ course is very tight, unless there is something guaranteed from it. But a lot of people don't know if they'll be guaranteed anything. I do like the fact that you've acknowledged the problem of needing experience to get experience though. If there's ""bragging rights"" of certifications, I think assisting people to get project experience is very important in a course."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgwoKT6OdJ4f_RNUDUN4AaABAg.9rya2lVktJI9s-QkH_QYv0	UgwoKT6OdJ4f_RNUDUN4AaABAg.9rya2lVktJI9s-QkH_QYv0	2023-07-10T03:10:37Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

Zeze	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktCKzmUHOTXiVLDEdnKUCA	COINS  I wholeheartedly agree with the college not being everyones choice opinion and for personal reasons as well.    I decided to sign up for community college straight out of highschool. However, I dropped out multiple times of about 3-4 semesters of trying. I was not mentally and emotionally healthy enough to tackle college.  I decided to stop college because I needed money and I was spending too much on school for practically nothing since I wasn’t passing classes.  I already had an interest in computers and luckily I was hired on as an IT technician for a local library. From there I got the comptia A+ certificate and have been hired on from multiple companies including Dell.   6 years later and I am still working in IT. However, thanks to Josh, I decided to go back to school and will be taking WGU’s Software Engineering course because of the past years I really grew a liking to programming.  I think the difference about me going back to school is because it’s on MY terms and it’s something that I want rather than someone’s wants ex: parents and society. As well as I am now mentally and emotionally stable to take on college responsibilities and actually looking forward to it.   I will also be taking Josh’s course because I really like how he is actively engaged about it on his YouTube channel and interviewing people that took it. I think his course will help me get a step further away from general IT, which I’ve been in for quite sometime now and am looking to learn a new skill set :). That’s where I think courses beat college, a relatively quick way to gather skills without having to use a lot of your valuable time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgyqNiUf7WIFhH1Qk154AaABAg	UgyqNiUf7WIFhH1Qk154AaABAg	2023-07-10T18:40:18Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

People whose worldview on the job process revolves around how you NEED certain pieces of paper to bypass gatekeeping won't change their mind just from one dude opening his mouth on the internet. You could show them 10 videos of people taking courses and acquiring jobs and haters will still perform mental aikido in coping exercises.

V V	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZju50Sqndz5lJVEvxcQDgg	WITH   Agree that a 2nd bachelors is rarely the right move however huge disagree @ 5:12 . Working on your resume doesn’t take the time or energy of getting a 2 bachelors and working on on resume isn’t alchemy results. You can’t make your resume something that it’s not. It’s just a record of what you did, if you wasted years and terrible jobs, there’s no magic that will make it a good resume. You can reformat and reword but it’s very minimal what you can “work on” when you were at Taco Bell for 3 months then McDonalds for 2 years.

Pursuing another bachelor's degree typically involves starting from the beginning and completing a full course of study, duplicating some coursework that has already been covered in the previous degree.

It drew attention in because of the lure of a prize, and then reading the contest description made the viewer more attentive to the video as well because at first I wasn't really going to watch it but was just going to listen to it. I was also kind of getting tired of seeing how many people were finding success with your course in your interview videos, because it always felt like maybe you were (consciously or unconsciously) cherry picking the success stories, there was no way that my story would be similar because in any kind of competition I always feel like my success will never be the advertised level of success. But I think the way you talked about how one should go about buying a course as unbiased as you could be while also just legit stating the value and intention of your course give your course more credibility and I hope that I'm able to take your course either from the winnings or if I can afford it at some point in the future."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgwKTp-3tq1mnqi0e0p4AaABAg	UgwKTp-3tq1mnqi0e0p4AaABAg	2023-07-10T09:35:16Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

Purizer	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcRLl1SAGopqbeS0-6of-Hw	"WITH I disagree, I believe online courses themselves are not scams recurring certifications that require you to go through another course/exam are scams. Universities have built their businesses by exploiting the youth asking them to pull out massive loans when they know little about finances so that they can get an ""education"". I personally I've taken multiple online courses and feel as if I only really did them so that I would not fall behind my peers.    Online courses can be quite valuable as they remove the non-important information and focus on the details that are important. You also get an expert explaining the topics at hand so that if you ever feel stuck you can get a direct answer rather than the multitude of answers that are on google."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=Ugya01PyYVKOdmJ6J5d4AaABAg	Ugya01PyYVKOdmJ6J5d4AaABAg	2023-07-11T05:30:27Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

I often ended up starting a course and after 2-3 sessions I would get disheartened and abandoned the course because I did not know over half the terminology being used in the course (prior knowledge was not there). Also, I don't know if it is just me (probably is!), if I see a price tag attached to something it automatically feels like it has a value compared to something that might be 1000X better AND free...gotta fix that lol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=Ugz5fO9rQZGwKlsOt514AaABAg	Ugz5fO9rQZGwKlsOt514AaABAg	2023-07-10T14:40:49Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

I do somewhat agree with the commenter that was talking about courses not carrying as much weight on resumes as a college degree. However, this also misses your point that courses are more effective when applied towards projects and experience rather than a resume. Just like you won’t know the full value of a course without taking it, I can’t imagine that hiring managers would either without seeing how the applicant applied the knowledge from the said course. If you’re going to buy a course, then you need to fully dedicate yourself to learning all the information offered. From my experience, taking courses while enrolled in college has helped me because they help supplement my knowledge with topics that a standard 4-year program doesn’t cover. While courses shouldn’t be the focus of your resume, you can use them to build things on your own to help you stand out from the rest of the 4-year college crowd.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgyEAoeClrnP0PLSmAt4AaABAg	UgyEAoeClrnP0PLSmAt4AaABAg	2023-07-10T21:37:15Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

Seth	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrD-8hyGDoKgAwri7vz3QEw	"BE  I don't think I've ever left a comment on a YouTube video before, so here goes my first one:  I think the point being missed by the commentors is that it is not the end degree/certificate/reward that matters, but the knowledge and skills you develop along the way. They are right, it's unlikely any company cares if you finished ""Josh's cyber course"", but they will care that you have done a project concerning Active Directory, or in Azure (I just recently followed along your tutorial for the Azure honeypot lab!). It is all about turning that course into tangible experiences and provide evidence that you know what you're talking about. I have just recently become aware of this, and wish I knew this 4 years ago when I completed by bachelor's in political science lol..  I also recommend that people check in with what their employers offer. I've been working in Amazon Fulfillment for almost two years now (keep me in your thoughts lol) and one of the biggest reasons I've stayed is the Career Choice program. They're essentially cutting me a $5,250 check every year to pursue any number of programs that they offer. I'm talking about getting a CDL, becoming a HVAC technician, a nurse, doing traditional college programs, or IT bootcamps. I just finished a program this past May (2023) in Cybersecurity through Flatiron School. While I'm disappointed my certificate in the end is basically worthless, the course itself provided me with so much information that I didn't have 9 months ago. I'm also about to start a Network Technician program that is giving me 3 CompTIA certifications (ITF, A+ & Net+) at no cost to me.  I would not of been able to do either of these bootcamps without Amazon. So really, check out what your employer is offering, even if you hate your current job, take advantage of what they are giving you FOR FREE so you can move onto something better!   Also, whether you're in college, Josh's course, or any number of other options, use these programs as opportunities to network! Life is not all about what you know, but who you know as well. Keep in contact with classmates, colleagues, and educators as they may present you with opportunities in the future that you wouldn't have otherwise.  Lastly, just want to give a shoutout to Josh for the awesome content. Found your channel about a month ago and have been regularly watching your tutorials and interview question videos. Hopefully by the end of this year I can no longer say I'm in Amazon fulfillment, and I'm off in the world of IT.

Ji Su Lee	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2UWNs5J0UC24YSB6o8TUA	WITH  I completely agree with the fact that today, information is so very accessible (probably a bit TOO excessible at times). I believe it's this vass amount of information that overwhelms people when conducting research, trying to learn something new, or just trying to dig deeper into a certain subject for free. Online courses on the other hand, basically feed you enough information for you to build a foundation off of a subject. From there, with basic knowledge built, it should be easier for one to conduct further research and/or build skills.

Josh Madakor	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L59ITupqEbdE_Wq47woVg	"**Rules for the $500 Cash Giveaway** **Please ensure you read all the rules before entering**  Contest Start: Monday, July 10, 2023, 12:30 AM Contest Finish: Wednesday, July 12, 2023, 12:30 AM  **All comments will be ""held for review"" for the first 48 hours during the contest!!!** Link to Demo at the bottom.  **How to Participate**  Step 1. Subscribe to the channel. I plan to do at least 8 more giveaways this year (non-interview videos) assuming people behave. Use the bell if you want to get notified.  Step 2. Throughout the video (from start to finish), 5 (FIVE) different secret words will appear on different parts of the screen for a brief moment at random times. There will be a little anime character holding up a sign with the word on it that may look something like this: https://github.com/joshmadakor1/YouTube-Utilities/assets/39254979/3a847f64-96ee-459b-b080-512dd39842e8  To enter the contest, you must make a comment that begins with one of the secret words, followed by your thoughts on the video or any criticisms you have (do you disagree?,  agree?, share your thoughts, etc.)  For example, if you find the secret phrase “PANDA57”, your contest entry comment will look like this:  @JaneDoe says: ----------- PANDA57 I disagree with you because x, y, and z -----------  Step 3. A maximum of TEN different winners will be selected. Two winners for EACH of the 5 secret words will be RANDOMLY selected (using Python, see link below), making a total of 10 winners at $50 each, for a total of $500. HOWEVER, a single person can win a maximum of two times ($100 winnings max per person).  Step 4. To have a chance of winning more than once, you’ll have to make more than one entry, which means you’ll have to find and use a different secret word for a total of up to a maximum of 5 possible entries. DO NOT make more than 5 entries. For example, if the secret words are [PANDA-55, FOX, DOG, P-22, CYBER-1], viewer ""Jimmy"" might find two of the secret words and decide to make two separate contest entry comments:  @Jimmy says (Comment 1): ----------- FOX I agree with you because a, b, and c. -----------  @Jimmy says (Comment 2): ----------- P-22 However, I disagree with you because of d, e, and f as well! -----------  Step 5. If you want to make life easy for me, watch your notifications for a reply from me in case you win. If you do win, please consider putting your Venmo ID or PayPal ID in your YouTube channel page. For example, either of the following: Venmo ID: @JoshMadakor PayPal ID: @JoshMadakor  Step 6. The contest will run for at least 48 hours. When time is up, all comments will be approved and made visible and a video recording running the python script and selecting winners will be taken as proof. I will then notify and pay the winners via Venmo or PayPal.  Important Notice 1 If I notice someone trying to cheat in any way or obviously doing something not in the spirit of the contest (for example, posting something that's obviously dumb) and you happen to “win”, I reserve the right to not pay you and pick the next person on the list who found the same secret word.  Important Notice 2 If you win and don't respond to my comments after 48 hours, I will give the next person in line who found the same secret word as you your winnings.  ⭐Related Links⭐ Past Contest Winners: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CfBS2nb1fk_K13X0YlTYYeOChmdGzrhFLeAkNuCCvew/edit#gid=0 These Giveaway Rules: https://github.com/joshmadakor1/YouTube-Utilities/blob/main/Contest/README.md Code Used to Select Winners: https://github.com/joshmadakor1/YouTube-Utilities/blob/main/Contest/giveaway.py VIDEO DEMO of How Winners Will Be Randomly Selected: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxziFcvNFOM YouTube’s Contest Policies and Guidelines: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1620498?hl=en YouTube’s Community Guidelines: https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_au/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVEjs_9CyU4&lc=UgwoKT6OdJ4f_RNUDUN4AaABAg	UgwoKT6OdJ4f_RNUDUN4AaABAg	2023-07-10T03:10:37Z	yVEjs_9CyU4

I don't fall for the too good to be true bit, but these guys made learning how to code seem like so much FUN!! Then things went to crap... lawyers got involved... bottom line is I do have an old school mentality about education. No Degree = 'not real education'. But I'm QUICKLY LEARNING that mentality is 100% trash!! I recently finished the GRC Master Class by DR. Gerald Auger, PhD. and landed my 1st interview like a week later for an IT Audit position!! I don't know if I got the job but that experience SPEAKS VOLUMES!!!  Not sure when I'll get to it, but I definitely want to take advantage of your course.

Mr Czr	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClA3keEIcm-SOGMHOR_A2Fw	SMART  - - - - - - -  I DISAGREE with the idea that online courses are scams. In your course for example the time you take to answer questions not only on your YouTube channel but on your discord too for your students. People have been succeeding following your advice and you have videos and comments from students and followers to show others that an online course or even a free lab on YouTube will help you get a job. What truly makes it not a scam is your honesty you tell people ok you have the resume part but now you need the technical side and proving you know what’s on your resume by building a portfolio, but it doesn’t stop there. You constantly preach that a boot camp or even a degree isn’t enough and give students pillars of employment to follow. Nobody else is doing this.
