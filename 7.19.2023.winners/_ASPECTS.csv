Trading Algo Matrix	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4mUPkdqItc2VsaYxPIL6Q	ASPECTS  Before expanding your job search to different locations, carefully consider the practical implications and potential challenges of relocating.

Amin1700	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYitak0dKdJpvfgABL6oH4w	ASPECTS I also agree with your point on saving a decent amount of savings prior to making the move across to a different state when applying for a new job. It’s always nice to have that peace of mind and having expenses settled before hand when applying to a new job or doing anything that has to do with leaving your home. I have been watching you since you had about 5,000 subs and it’s amazing to see how far you have come. You truly deserve every bit of it and I just wanted to thank you for all the knowledge that you have presented :)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugx110gSaAeW_z-KctJ4AaABAg	Ugx110gSaAeW_z-KctJ4AaABAg	2023-07-17T16:13:32Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

X	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4zTUghxpRa8Bus_Han18Kg	@Josh Madakor  -----------  XMOST  I think a lot of what makes the process of beginning is, at what point am i good enough to apply for the jobs asking for a bachelors with 10 years experience?  XHAVE Or how much money is required to travel to another state or country to live?

Faris	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYEM68jLnfE3DuzsPjGXf7Q	ASPECTS  I agree with the last strategy is something I wish I knew or planned ahead of time. Saving money to move because moving cost actually held me back a little. I moved to a small undisclosed town and there is a few international students, so apparently when C-19 happened back in 2021 a lot of students left unexpectedly. The town decided to increase the utilities deposit to about 500$… I did not know this, nothing online mentioned this, only if I spoken with someone from the town I would have known.. and then same thing with finding an apartment which i was able to do but another deposit there and there. Uhual rentals, gas and car maintenance to drive back and forth. YEAH it is a learning experience. PREPLAN. PERHAPS ALMOST 2 MONTHS IN ADVANCE.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugz2AEcEQYC1RIpX6GF4AaABAg	Ugz2AEcEQYC1RIpX6GF4AaABAg	2023-07-15T18:33:20Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Purizer	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcRLl1SAGopqbeS0-6of-Hw	ASPECTS   Hi Josh, Great video on a topic that isn't discussed more. Moving is a huge mental and finanical hurdle for some people myself included. When I started out I saved as much money as I could from my factory job while I was going to college. When I moved felt a bit alone in a new city with little to no support however, made the best of I could and evenutally got a remote job near home. I've been working for the last 5 years and have learned lots and got burned out on the way but hey the coporate wheel never stops turning, always more work to do no matter how hard you work.   My goal was to stay near family so I could still take care of them while building my career and safe to say it all worked out. Now I'm grinding the MSCSIA hoping to finish this winter and land first real cyber security job.  Thanks for all that you do, it's seeing people like you that pushes me to further my education.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgwEiGIQehsGd6sBphF4AaABAg	UgwEiGIQehsGd6sBphF4AaABAg	2023-07-17T16:47:37Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
The BitBaker	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQDQ9VOSTq8F2NLeTACHRQ	"ASPECTS I agree with everything here. The expectation of trying to stay in a certain region (or full remote for that first IT job) holds many many candidates back from getting their foot in the door. Also, it's a numbers game. Why do the opposite of what people are doing (applying everywhere) and expect success?  By the way... absolutely love the ""stats"" based approach to career growth and development...no one else on youtube is doing that. Great way to really put it in place, and it made me take a step back and take stock of where I am in my career (and GIT GUD)"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgwqmgMrGBTLZh9RdfJ4AaABAg	UgwqmgMrGBTLZh9RdfJ4AaABAg	2023-07-17T18:44:45Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Roland Schaapveld	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeeGpnebOYOQcHg_2YgS9g	ASPECTS I do agree that this is probably one of the best ways to land the first job, and i have considered it for my family. (Because it could double or triple our household income) but there are ways that you can get experience that isn't necessarily job related that can be added to the resume. Non prifits, volunteer, and online resources that allow you to practice the skills instead of just gain the knowledge are great examples that can be added to a resume.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugy3UkXu7H5x2cfUKHZ4AaABAg	Ugy3UkXu7H5x2cfUKHZ4AaABAg	2023-07-17T17:21:52Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
