WhosUrPapi	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUmETri_k_t8_tv9oXoOckg	XMOST  I agree with your video. However, it makes it really hard to make these exponential moves across the country for those who are looking for a career change at a later stage in life.

I’m even going as far as offering free labor to get that experience in the Bay Area but have yet to get any luck. I’m currently pursuing a bachelors in cyber security at WGU so hopefully as I rack up those certs I get more calls back	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgyO1ynBGdk11gbBC6J4AaABAg	UgyO1ynBGdk11gbBC6J4AaABAg	2023-07-17T15:22:23Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Jośe Jordan	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfXVInOL6BUpAfNThaYIWtw	XMOST I completely agree with your point, Josh. Tech talent concentration in major cities can create fierce competition for job seekers. Exploring emerging tech markets like Oklahoma City presents a unique advantage with less competition per application.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgxemPVe66eo3RJ5TWV4AaABAg	UgxemPVe66eo3RJ5TWV4AaABAg	2023-07-18T15:32:41Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
Jamel Appsolute	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy53tsp1wbnZ0NP3wiqHyWA	XMOST It makes sense to take the path that doesn't have a lot of people walking on it at the same time or hitting the gym at 5 AM versus  5 PM when everyone is. What specific path is the author referring to?  I have been looking for exclusive remote jobs because I have a comfortable position that does not pay enough to continue working here. I am looking to pivot into tech, so this does help. Great stuff, and thank you.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugyzg1mSR4Q_l6T7CeR4AaABAg	Ugyzg1mSR4Q_l6T7CeR4AaABAg	2023-07-17T15:53:58Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
Angelina Tyler	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCACDdbrLxCCS0CMoGQIJEMw	XMOST Your advice to consider emerging tech markets like Oklahoma City is a breath of fresh air, Josh.
