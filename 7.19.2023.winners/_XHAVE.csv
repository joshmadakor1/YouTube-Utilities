Mariah Wheat	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAcGEn_1_2bK4vofayL9-SA	XHAVE Josh, does your entry level IT course take people from not knowing much more than turning on a computer to being ready for a support position?

I'm currently making myself liquid as possible and, at the same time, upskilling in cybersecurity. What you say is true, and I have witnessed this myself. Last year, I interviewed with Google for a Data Center position in Los Angeles. The position was filled after my interview, but they offered me another location in Oklahoma City. I declined that offer, but I noticed it was still available months after. For most of us trying to get into this field, the goal is to get the experience asap. Once we're in, it shouldn't be that difficult finding another position somewhere else if you like.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugz1-U-CSqr7nJduSS54AaABAg	Ugz1-U-CSqr7nJduSS54AaABAg	2023-07-18T06:06:01Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Valentine Erondu	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGxAQ6xKoMc-72FubOnL2gw	@XHAVE  I absolutely agree with you here. I think it is to the advantage of anyone trying to get their career started to explore opportunities anywhere regardless of pay or geographic location, especially when one lacks experience. The moment one gets that experienced, then they can have the liberty to choose not just the location they want to work, but also the company they want to work. But without a solid well grounded experience, one can't limit themselves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgwGoycC9cDDEtymdC54AaABAg	UgwGoycC9cDDEtymdC54AaABAg	2023-07-18T00:14:40Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Dan Peoples	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ0ap0BiCbldHpAQ98VRL3A	XHAVE   As someone who has moved IRL from a mid-sized somewhat sheltered/isolated community to a top-tier tech metroplex, I can wholeheartedly attest to the stark differences in terms of both incredible opportunities in the big metroplex that I now live in and the very real lack of quality talent in the mid-sized town that I moved from.    I was incredibly lucky enough to leverage my position to pivot into an IT role that I am currently growing into as a full-time student.      Real-Life Example:  In the small town that I am from, these kinds of Jr -Or- Learn-as-you-go opportunities seemed to be almost non-existent, I think because the fewer job openings overall meant many fewer Junior opportunities.   -Vs-  The bigger metroplexes usually have many more jobs than people to fill them, hence the likelihood of landing a job by ‚Äúmaking your own luck‚Äù with manufactured experience, portfolio projects, a quality resume/LinkedIn, certifications, continued education, and growing your personal stats.  Conclusion:      The moral of the story is ‚Äì I was willing to work in a job that I was not in love with (but was good at) to get in front of the right situation. With a little luck, I struck gold and now work in IT, while going to school as a full-time student.    I would certainly agree that being willing to make a move, breaking out of your comfort zone, embracing new challenges, and learning new skills, is a recipe for success if you‚Äôre willing to expand your horizons.     It's not easy, none of this is easy, but it is doable, and who knows maybe one day I‚Äôll move back to that small town.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugx84KtX1f3O9mS2cF14AaABAg	Ugx84KtX1f3O9mS2cF14AaABAg	2023-07-18T03:11:03Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
