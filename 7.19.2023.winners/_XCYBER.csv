Valentine Erondu	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGxAQ6xKoMc-72FubOnL2gw	@XCYBER  I can relate to your experience. Upon graduating from college, my reluctance to move out of my city severely limited my opportunities. Fear of the unknown prevented me from pursuing interviews that were only a couple of hours away. As a result, I settled for low-paying jobs while searching for employment within my city, which ultimately hindered my progress and caused missed opportunities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgybX9a8PLQcFDBMMrR4AaABAg	UgybX9a8PLQcFDBMMrR4AaABAg	2023-07-18T00:16:40Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Chris Chapman	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRebfcfrzLQF-XpcTi-XYow	XCYBER I agree with a lot of what you said! I hear that looking in smaller locations or less desired locations the pool of candidates is smaller.

CyberChronicler	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8jm0KFcMfZ1DbDXDLl2PcA	"XCyber I agree that being willing to move in order to find that first cybersecurity job would greatly increase your chances of getting hired, I also really like the fact that you outlined/mentioned the opportunity cost of holding out for that ""Perfect"" job, because not many talk about that.

Robert White	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIEwAKtYWfN-5yB8_4tNSjQ	XCYBER From what I have seen, early career experience as a SWE is worth its weight in gold. I just have to bite the bullet and get that initial experience under my belt instead of lying to myself that the market will recover in a short time frame and that I can get a much higher paying job if I jobsearch longer or over prepare.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgzvviwW9gbB3NoYa8x4AaABAg	UgzvviwW9gbB3NoYa8x4AaABAg	2023-07-17T15:56:47Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
Randy Eid	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUonBf_4eMcYLwR16w1O48Q	XCYBER People who have families and/or close friends cannot justify the big move to start gaining experience in the field. I, personally, would prefer to wait for a good opportunity nearby or find a good remote position rather than lose the personal connections with my family and friends.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgycG8esICgPbbWv4bV4AaABAg	UgycG8esICgPbbWv4bV4AaABAg	2023-07-18T18:49:11Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Jośe Jordan	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfXVInOL6BUpAfNThaYIWtw	XCYBER Josh, your insight about the tech talent distribution across different locations is spot-on. The competition for tech jobs in major cities like Seattle, New York, or San Francisco can be fierce. Considering places like Oklahoma City, where there may be fewer tech jobs but also less competition, is a smart move.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgwYGMOxTLxrxH-EyJJ4AaABAg	UgwYGMOxTLxrxH-EyJJ4AaABAg	2023-07-18T15:33:10Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Amin1700	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYitak0dKdJpvfgABL6oH4w	XCYBER I agree with the idea of expanding your horizon and finding opportunity elsewhere, outside of your hometown. It may be more beneficial for younger talent to be able to leave their comfort zones and embark on an adventure in a new area as well as having the least amount of competition with jobs that don’t have that many applicants. I believe it is a solid idea to first work any job, as it is really experience that matters the most in this field, and then come back to your hometown or anywhere else with a much more solid resume, portfolio, and or more certs as the job could perhaps help with earning certs and using the money for the job for further self-education. I also wanted to mention that it is a huge opportunity cost by going to college and not finding a job while employed, as it’s really that HR mostly cares about in addition to your degree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgyzXmLWtmoVueC1fgV4AaABAg	UgyzXmLWtmoVueC1fgV4AaABAg	2023-07-17T15:59:52Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

Liz	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC39QCgjLlAr7uL3Oo1mxpwg	I’ve been trying to break into the xcyber world and I’m still trying. Gaining experience in the way outlined in the video is something I would be interested in but there is one aspect stopping me. I don’t xhave a car. I also just don’t know how drive in general. Living in the U.S. specifically places not walking are biking friendly is a huge blockade. I’ll just have to get my experience online. I’ll also learn how to drive one day. Just have to find someone willing to teach me in my close circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgwCa0khrur0vOZtVwl4AaABAg	UgwCa0khrur0vOZtVwl4AaABAg	2023-07-17T16:51:54Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
Alex Morales	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqE_K6Bf1LRRJTZyzqSqN9A	XCYBER Working with different people is one of the secret gems of looking for work in a different city because you’ll have to learn to deal with different personalities anyway so it makes sense to expose yourself to as many of them as possible to shorten the learner curve of dealing with new personalities and possibly befriend new people that you otherwise would not have known!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgydCMIw_SoNWmgujEp4AaABAg	UgydCMIw_SoNWmgujEp4AaABAg	2023-07-17T15:06:40Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
