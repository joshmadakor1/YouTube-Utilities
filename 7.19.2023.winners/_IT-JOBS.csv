You really have to expand your search geographically to ensure you can find a good job.  However, like you said, this isn't for everyone.  I find myself in the situation where I've got kids and ailing immediate family members that require care. I would also point out that working in a smaller metropolitan area could help broaden your skills.  It seems to me that many jobs in ""Tech Hubs"" seem to be very specialized. Smaller regions need IT too and could provide you the opportunity to do more."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=UgzCO4URH2dLilylayp4AaABAg	UgzCO4URH2dLilylayp4AaABAg	2023-07-17T18:14:30Z	jQCqglG5IBQ

However, when I apply for jobs out of state, I've heard recruiters say they are more likely to look for talent in that state anyways. @Josh do you change your resume to whatever location you want to work in as well?

Bch08	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xn86yX97bDTy4K1NjW8lA	"IT-JOBS  I agree with the ""S tier strategy"" in job hunting because it allows candidates to increase their chances of getting hired and build their experience and resume faster. When candidates expand the geographic region in which they are willing to work, they are opening themselves up to a larger pool of opportunities. This means that they are more likely to get hired sooner, and they can also build their experience and resume more quickly. In addition, working in a different geographic region can help candidates build their network. When candidates meet new people in a new city, they are essentially creating connections that can also help them to find their next job. These connections can also help them learn about new opportunities and to get their foot in the door with potential employers."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCqglG5IBQ&lc=Ugyi65J2IKO0vPhqPLN4AaABAg	Ugyi65J2IKO0vPhqPLN4AaABAg	2023-07-18T10:24:22Z	jQCqglG5IBQ
